        I am Priyatham Rama Sai, a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer with strong
        experience in manual, regression, UAT, and API testing.
        My 8+ years of System Administration experience helps me understand
        applications beyond testing, including environments, servers, and stability.
    </p>

    <p>
        Alongside my QA career, I provide freelance services in website and
        Android app development, focusing on clean design, performance,
        and reliability.
